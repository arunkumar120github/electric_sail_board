        A new social media platform called Electric Sailboat Depot (ESD) focuses on the growing market for electric sailboat propulsion. Since automobiles on the electric vehicle market are changed every three to five years, selecting an EV is not too difficult. However, yachts cost a lot of money and last for over 20 years. Despite having a far longer usable life than cars, sailboats require costly maintenance and replacement as their auxiliary diesel engines get older. Every boat is unique, making it difficult to replace a diesel engine with an electric motor. However, switching to electric power has several advantages, including cleaner environmental practises, quieter operation, no unpleasant diesel odour, less maintenance, fewer running costs, and increased comfort.
